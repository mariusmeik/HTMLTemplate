            <p>The term “dark web" sounds ominous, and there's a reason for that. The dark web is a part of the internet that's made up of hidden sites you can't find through conventional web browsers. Instead, you must rely on the Tor browser—a web browser that anonymizes your web traffic within its internal network—and search engines designed specifically to unearth these hidden sites.

                Dark web sites use encryption software so their visitors and owners can remain anonymous—it’s why the dark web is home to so much illegal activity. However, this side of the internet isn’t reserved for criminals. Over 2.7 million active users browse the dark web every day, and many do so for legitimate reasons.</p>

            <p>"The dark web has a bad rap, but there are benefits to using it. For example, dissidents who fear political prosecution from their governments might use the dark web to communicate with each other. As many as 70.79% of users claim to use the Tor browser for anonymity, 62.28% said they use it for additional security, and 27.07% used it out of curiosity about the dark web.

                Because there’s no way to track users, communicating over the dark web ensures the utmost security and privacy. This is integral for people like:
                
                Journalists and whistleblowers working together to expose corruption at corporations and government agencies
                Citizens of oppressive or authoritarian governments needing to access news sources critical of their governments that have been blocked by traditional web browsers
                Political protestors wanting to remain anonymous while protesting the actions of their government
                Users seeking medical advice without revealing their identity
                Journalists interviewing sources who must remain anonymous
                Everyday internet users can also reap the benefits of the dark web. Anonymity and added security can be useful for activities like:
                
                Accessing free academic research
                Using ad-free search engines
                Accessing geo-blocked content
                Securing cryptocurrency wallets
                Using social media without government monitoring
                Finding niche content, like anonymous chess games or blogs on secret underground tunnels
                Accessing anonymous chat boards"<a href="https://us.norton.com/blog/how-to/how-can-i-access-the-deep-web" target="_blank">[2]</a></p>

            <h1>Terrorism on dark web</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="textDiv">
            <p >"The terms Deep Web, Deep Net, Invisible Web, or Dark Web refer to the content on the World Wide Web that is not indexed by standard search engines. One can describe the Internet as composed of layers: the “upper” layer, or the Surface Web, can easily be accessed by regular searches. However, “deeper” layers, the content of the Deep Web, have not been indexed by traditional search engines such as Google. Michael K. Bergman who wrote the seminal paper on the Deep Web, compared searching the Internet to dragging a net across the surface of the ocean: a great deal may be caught in the net, but there is a wealth of information that is deeper and therefore missed. In fact, most of the Web's information is buried far down on sites, and standard search engines are unable to access it.During the early days of the Internet, online information was easily indexed and there was no difficulty for users to access it easily. However, as the usage of the Internet expanded, conventional search engines were able to retrieve static pages but proved inefficient for dynamic pages. A static page is one linked to other pages on the Internet while a dynamic page is linked to a particular web-page and can be retrieved only through targeted queries or programs. This created a gap between the static and dynamic web-pages on the Internet and the chasm started to widen as time passed. Thus, already in 1994, Jill Ellsworth coined the phrase “invisible Web” to refer to information that remains “invisible” to queries of conventional search engines used at that time. In 2001, Bergman coined another term, “Deep Web,” commonly defined as informational content on the Internet that is: (a) inaccessible through direct queries by conventional search engines; (b) accessed only through targeted queries or keywords; (c) either not indexed or unable to be indexed by conventional search engines; (d) protected by security mechanisms like login IDs, passwords, membership registrations, and codes.Footnote

                It is almost impossible to measure the size of the Deep Web because the majority of its information is hidden or blocked. While some early estimates put the size of the Deep Web at 400–500 times that of the Surface Web,Footnote “the changing dynamic of how information is accessed and presented means that the Deep Web is growing exponentially and at a rate that defies quantification.”Footnote According to a study published in Nature, Google indexes no more than 16 percent of the Surface Web and misses all of the Deep Web. Any given search turns up just 0.03 percent of the information that exists online. As RAND Corporation expert Lilian Ablon noted, “Everything above the water is what we would call the surface web that can be indexed through Google or you can find through a search engine. But below the water that huge iceberg is 80% bigger than what is above the water, that's the deep web, that's the part of the web that's not indexed. There is so much of the web that we can't just Google for; it's dark to us, it's dark to Google.”Footnote
                
                The deepest layers of the Deep Web, a segment known as the Dark Web, contain content that has been intentionally concealed. The “Dark Web” can be defined as the portion of the Deep Web that contains generally illegal and anti-social information and can only be accessed through specialized browsers. Thus, for example, the Dark Web is used for material such as child pornography, unauthorized leaks of sensitive information, money laundering, copyright infringement, credit card fraud, identity theft, illegal sales of weapons, and so on. A 2014 study by University of Portsmouth computer science researcher Gareth Owen presented the results of a six-month probe of the Web's dark layers. Owen found that the most commonly requested types of content on these Dark Web platforms were child pornography followed by black markets, while the individual sites with the highest traffic were dedicated to botnet operations.Footnote In 2014, journalist Jamie Bartlett in his book The Dark Net describes a range of underground and emergent sub-cultures, including social media racists, cam girls, self-harm communities, drug markets, crypto-anarchists and transhumanists.Footnote In recent years, the Dark Web has been moving toward more secretive locations due to the crackdown of government agencies on it.
                
                The Dark Web can be visited by any Web user, but it is very difficult to work out who is behind the sites and the sites are not found by using search engines. Individuals can access the Dark Web by using special software such as Tor (short for The Onion Router) or I2P (Invisible Internet Project). Tor was initially created by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory as a tool for anonymously communicating online. Tor relies on a network of volunteer computers to route users' Web traffic through a series of other users' computers so that the traffic cannot be traced to the original user. Some developers have created tools—such as Tor2web—that allow individuals to access Tor-hosted content without downloading and installing the Tor software, although accessing the Dark Web through these means does not anonymize activity. Not all Dark Web sites use Tor, but the principle remains the same. The visitor has to use the same encryption tool as the site and—crucially—know where to find the site, in order to type in the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and visit. Once on the Dark Web, users often navigate it through directories such as the “Hidden Wiki,” which organizes sites by category, similar to Wikipedia. In the Dark Web, individuals may communicate through means such as secure e-mail, Web chats, or personal messaging hosted on Tor.Footnote
                
                The Dark Web made headlines in 2015 with the hacking of the Ashley Madison database. Ashley Madison is an online dating service for married people, under the slogan “Life is short. Have an affair.” The company received attention on 15 July 2015, after hackers broke into its database, stealing the personal data of some 37 million customers. Later, the group dumped 9.7 GB worth of data onto the Dark Web including the e-mails, names, home addresses, sexual fantasies, and credit card information of the clients. The Ashley Madison hack is not the first time that the Dark Web has made it into the news. Perhaps the most high-profile story is the case of the online black market Silk Road, the illegal drug marketplace which operated on the Dark Web for two years before the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) shut down this website in 2013 and arrested site founder Ross Ulbricht. He was subsequently sentenced to life in prison. The Dark Web has been associated with the infamous WikiLeaks, the classified media site, as well as bitcoins, said to be the currency of the Dark Web. Over its two-year run at the top, Silk Road made over US$1.2 billion in bitcoin.Footnote
                
                Terrorist Migration to the Dark Web
                Terrorists have been active on various online platforms since the late 1990s.Footnote Paradoxically, the very decentralized network of communication that the U.S. intelligence and defense agencies created out of fear of the Soviet Union now serves the interests of the greatest foe of the West's security services since the end of the Cold War: international terror. Terrorist organizations and their supporters maintain thousands of websites and social networking platforms, exploiting the unregulated, anonymous, and easily accessible nature of the Internet to convey an array of messages to a variety of targeted audiences. Numerous studies have identified no fewer than eight different ways in which terrorists are using the Internet to advance their cause. These range from psychological warfare and propaganda to highly instrumental uses such as fund-raising, recruitment, data mining, and coordination of actions.
                
                However, the Surface Web was discovered to be too risky for anonymity-seeking terrorists: they could be monitored, traced, and found. The Dark Web and terrorism seem to be made for each other—terrorists need an anonymous, hidden network that is readily available yet generally inaccessible and invisible. The Dark Web is very beneficial for terrorist groups: While they may lose a broad audience that is available on the Surface Web, they can exploit the obscurity of the Dark Web to further their goals. Many of the terrorist websites and social media on the Surface Web are monitored by counterterrorism agencies and are often shut down or hacked. In contrast, on the Dark Web, decentralized and anonymous networks aid in evading arrest and the closure of these terrorist platforms. Thus, the Dark Web is like a “treasure trove” that provides terrorists with ideally secretive communication, enabling the sharing of knowledge and instructions, posting training manuals, online recruitment, planning and coordination of actions.Footnote According to the London-based Quilliam Foundation, this trend should not surprise anyone: “Attempts to block extremist material online will always fail. …” The position paper by Quiliam about the British government's attempts to block extremist activity on the Web, states: “The terrorist material reappears on the Internet as quickly as it is banished and this policy risks driving fanatics on to the ‘dark web’ where they are even harder to track.”Footnote Moreover, “Islamist forums and chat rooms in English and French are still widely available, but... a large portion of more extremist Islamic discourse now takes place within the dark web.”Footnote
                
                In the past, terrorists were quick to adopt and apply every emerging online platform. In the late 1990s, it was the use of websites. Then they added the more interactive forums, chat-rooms and the video-sharing and picture-sharing platforms of YouTube, Instagram, and the like. The introduction and fast spread of social media such as Twitter or Facebook were quickly noted by numerous terrorist groups who started posting messages, videos, manuals, and propaganda material on the popular social media. Thus, the notion of the Dark Web with its unique advantages of anonymity, secrecy, and communicator-controlled access is certainly more than appealing for them. In July 2015, The FBI announced that Islamic State, or Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) (or Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant [ISIL]), is using the Dark Web to inspire terror attacks across the globe. FBI Director James Comey warned that ISIS is using new forms of communication and encryption, and his government's current legal and technological capabilities may not be sufficient to keep up. “ISIL's activities on the Surface Web are now being monitored closely, and the decision by a number of governments to take down or filter extremist content has forced the jihadists to look for new online safe havens,” Beatrice Berton writes in a new report on ISIS's use of the dark net. “The Dark Web is a perfect alternative as it is inaccessible to most but navigable for the initiated few—and it is completely anonymous,” Berton noted.Footnote Tor browser e-mail services such as Torbox and Sigaint are popular among the jihadists because they hide both their identities and their location.
                
                In March 2015, jihadists posted online an e-book titled How to Survive in the West: A Mujahid Guide. This is the latest in a series of e-books compiled by supporters of and recruiters for the Islamic State. This e-book's chapter titles include: “Hiding the Extremist Identity,” “Earning Money,” “Internet Privacy,” “Training,” “Bomb-Making,” “Transporting Weapons,” and “What Happens When You Are Spied On And Get Raided.” One of the techniques discussed in the guidebook is the use of Tor when searching for and researching jihadi topics online.Footnote On 11 June 2015, Virginia resident Ali Shukri Amin, who had been arrested on 4 March 2015, admitted in court that he had operated several prolific pro-ISIS accounts. On his sites, he provided privacy information to his followers, and referred to Tor repeatedly. For example, when asked on 13 July 2014 “Why are people asking about how to use TOR?” he replied, “To be anonymous online, they don't want the government seeing what they do and getting them in trouble.” He also advised his audience “Don't make these statements inside US unless you're operating through TOR and Ghost VPN.”
                
                Following the attacks in Paris (November 2015), ISIS has turned to the Dark Web to spread news and propaganda in an apparent attempt to protect the identities of the group's supporters and safeguard its content from hacktivists. The move comes after hundreds of websites associated with ISIS were taken down as part of the Operation Paris (OpParis) campaign launched by the amorphous hacker collective Anonymous. ISIS's media outlet, Al- Hayat Media Center, posted a link and explanations on how to get to their new Dark Web site on a forum associated with ISIS. The announcement was also distributed on ISIS's Telegram channel, the encrypted communication application. The messages shared links (hidden below) to a Tor service with a “.onion” address, more commonly known as a website on the Dark Web. The text of the forum message was:
                
                The name of Allah the Merciful given the very narrow on the site # Asaddarat_klavh so that it is deleting any new domain after its publication announce the launch of the site on the “Dark web” * will work for users of the Tor and users of ordinary users of the Tor link: XXXXXXXXXX link ordinary users: XXXXXXX and we promise you that we are continuing to try to get a new range of normal and we will publish, God willing, when you get it next to the scope of the Tor. Glory be to God, His Prophet and the believers.
                
                The site in the Dark Web contains an archive of ISIS propaganda materials, including its documentary-style film, The Flames of War. The site also includes a link to the terrorist group's private messaging portal on Telegram.
                
                Terrorists are always looking for newer and better applications and platforms in order to maintain their online presence on as many outlets as possible. Our 18-year-long research project on monitoring terrorist use of online platforms has yielded a database containing all terrorist groups' use of websites, chat rooms, social media, and so on.Footnote An analysis of the database reveals new trends in terrorist use of the Web, including, the newest one—the use of the Dark Web."<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1057610X.2015.1119546?scroll=top&needAccess=true" target="_blank">[3]</a></p>

            <h1>Policy issues pertaining to the Dark Web</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="textDiv">
            <p>Creating policy to address the Dark Web requires an understanding of the benefits and risks of anonymity and of an open internet. Rash and sweeping legislation has the potential to encroach on civil liberties and to be a nightmare to enforce. On the other hand, not addressing the Dark Web will allow illicit activities to persist unabated. It is impossible to regulate the Dark Web in isolation; any regulations must be applicable to the internet as a whole and will thus affect Surface Web users, Deep Web researchers, and Dark Web criminals alike. This section will explore two important policy issues surrounding the Dark Web: the appropriate role of government, and the tactics that government enforcers should employ.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="headerDiv" id="Policy issue 1">
            <h1>Major policy issue 1: What is the appropriate role for the government in the Dark Web?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="textDiv">
            <p>When new technologies arise, the government must determine its role in regulating them. Technological progress can change the ways our laws apply and necessitate new laws. For example, the United States is still struggling to adapt old laws governing telephones and television to the internet. The Dark Web is a brand new topic to many policy-makers, and it is essential that they become informed before enacting policy rather than learning from mistakes. Current U.S. laws are vaguely applicable to the Dark Web, but government agencies have not solidified policies on how to regulate it within a legal framework.

                The most important Dark Web policy issue is regulating Tor. The Dark Web could not exist without anonymising technology. Anonymity is the crux of what makes the Dark Web different from the Surface Web, so policy regarding anonymity and, by extension, the use of Tor, is most relevant. There are two central challenges to creating policy for the Dark Web: protecting anonymity and working internationally. Policies regarding the Dark Web must be clear and internationally agreeable, without compromising the ideals of the American people.
                
                The first challenge is that there is nothing inherently criminal about using Tor for anonymity, but there is no clear way to sort the criminals from the innocent users if they are all anonymous. If there were no criminals using Tor, the law enforcement community would not be pushing so hard against the anonymity that it provides. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to hold someone accountable for their actions if their identity is unknown, and it is hard to unmask one person without having the capability to deanonymise everyone else using Tor.
                
                The second challenge is that the internet is inherently very international, which makes coordinating regulations challenging. One country does not control the entire internet, and as much as some nations would like to have full control over the ideas coming in and out of their country, they have not fully achieved success with a ‘great firewall’. The internet cannot be regulated country by country without destroying the benefits that the internet brings to all countries, so finding consensus is important. There is some content, such as images of child abuse, that all countries agree should be illegal and banned across all distribution outlets. There is other content however, like political dissidence, where different countries have dramatically different stances.
                
                The United States currently has some laws that are applicable to Dark Web activity, but they were not specifically designed to meet the challenge of the Dark Web. For example, hacking is often enabled by the Dark Web. Hackers will purchase malware from other hackers, or will use a Dark Web method of collecting ransom from ransomware attacks. Hacking is regulated by the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), which bans trespassing on, unauthorised accessing of, and damaging computers in interstate or international commerce. The CFAA also bars trafficking, unauthorised computer access, and computer espionage (Sui, Caverlee, and Rudesill Citation2015). These U.S. regulations are perfectly sufficient to handle hacking, but they do not specifically tackle the challenge of anonymity online, and they are not necessarily effective beyond U.S. borders, from where most cybercrime against the U.S. is launched. Regulating cybercrime on the Dark Web therefore becomes exponentially more challenging when the international community is brought in.
                
                Three members of the international community have each pushed agendas relating to Tor that are inconsistent with the aims of the U.S. government. China has made efforts to block access to Tor, Russia has made efforts to deanonymise Tor for political purposes, and Austria has made efforts to eliminate Tor traffic within its borders. U.S. regulators must be cognizant of the diverse sentiments of the international community. While countries such as the U.S. and Germany have supported Tor, going as far as to fund it, other countries are vehemently opposed to it (Tor: Sponsors, n.d.). This poses a major challenge to international policy development. China has some of the strictest and best-enforced policies regarding internet regulation. They heavily censor online conversation and quickly silence those who speak out for collective action or otherwise threaten the regime (King, Pan, and Roberts Citation2013). There are many free speech advocates in China, including Murong Xuecun, who strongly support the Dark Web because it empowers them to speak freely. Xuecun has warned that ‘the great firewall’ creates ‘a Chinese information prison where ignorance fosters ideologies of hatred and aggression’ (Clemmitt Citation2016). China certainly takes seriously the threat that Tor poses to their information control. In 2008, China blocked the Tor project’s website in an effort to prevent users from downloading the service. Then in 2009, China sought to block all of the public relay computers that Tor employs to anonymise users (Clemmitt Citation2016). The Chinese government released the following statement regarding the internet in a 2010 white paper: ‘Within Chinese territory the Internet is under the jurisdiction of Chinese sovereignty,’ and Chinese ‘laws and regulations clearly prohibit the spread of information that contains content subverting state power, undermining national unity [or] infringing upon national honour and interests’ (Clemmitt Citation2016).
                
                China is in the company of Russia, which recently passed some of the strictest and most oppressive laws regarding internet use and Dark Web activity. On 2 August 2016, Russia’s Federal Security Service began enforcing the collection of encryption keys from internet service providers. A refusal to turn over keys can result in a one million rouble fine ($15,000) (Vitaris, Russian [Sic] is collecting encryption keys as ‘anti-terrorism’ legislation goes into effect, Citation2016). The Russian government has also made efforts to break the anonymity of the Dark Web. They entered into a contract with Rostec worth 3.9 million roubles (around $60,000) to ‘research the possibility of obtaining technical information on users of [the] anonymous network Tor and users’ equipment’ (Vitaris, Russian Government Sues Firm for Failing to Deanonymize Tor Users Citation2015). Rostec was unable to hack into the Tor project by the due date of November 2015, and the Russian government is now suing them for the failure.
                
                One of the most dramatic policy actions was taken by Austria in 2014. Authorities arrested a man who had made his computer a Tor relay, and held him accountable for ‘contribut[ing] to the completion’ of a cybercrime committed by another Tor user who had no involvement with the arrested man, beyond the fact that the cybercriminal’s traffic was routed through the Austrian man’s computer (Clemmitt Citation2016). The verdict has set a precedent that it is potentially illegal to operate a Tor exit relay in Austria, which is a major blow to Austrians who wish to support the project. Cooperation between Austria and the U.S. would be challenging given how strongly the Austrian government opposes the service and how this contradicts the U.S. legal precedent of not holding tools responsible for the actions of their users.
                
                Like all battles, the battle between Tor and the governments that wish to shut it down is two-sided. In response to China’s action of blocking all known IP addresses of Tor relays, Tor has created special relays called bridges. Their IP addresses are kept secret, and users must go through a lengthy application process to request the IP address of a bridge if they wish to access the network. This application process is no problem for Chinese Tor users who are willing to go to considerable lengths to connect to the network, but it poses a major challenge to the Chinese government’s goal of blocking all the IPs, because they cannot just request them all at once, and as long as any one bridge is open, Chinese users can connect to Tor (Clemmitt Citation2016). This just goes to highlight the fact that access to the Dark Web is a dynamic challenge. Yesterday’s policy may no longer be applicable today.
                
                The United States must rise to the challenge of enacting policy that successfully strikes the balance between protecting user anonymity and preventing illegal activity online. Nations around the globe have different stances on how best to tackle the challenge of Tor. Given that international cooperation will be essential, governments must work together towards creating smart Dark Web policy. The specific tactics for intervening on the Dark Web must be carefully considered. Many governments, including the U.S. government, have made attempts in the past with varying degrees of success. By learning from past mistakes, leaders can create policy that effectively addresses the challenge of tomorrow’s internet.</p>

        <div class="headerDiv" id="Policy issue 2">
            <h1>Major policy issue 2: What are the appropriate tactics for government intervention on the Dark Web?</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="textDiv">
            <p>Once the United States government has determined its role in regulating the Dark Web, it must decide which tactics it will use to carry out that role. The government must use tactics that take down criminal Dark Web activity while protecting the anonymity of innocent users to the maximum extent possible. In the interest of not compromising any confidential information, the tactics explored in this section are those that have been publicly released. This section will discuss the lessons that can be learned from previously used tactics. The most effective and reasonable tactics are those that can target specific anonymous users and hold them accountable for their actions rather than deanonymising vast swathes of user data.

                The combined capabilities of a small handful of government agencies can be effectively employed towards the end of policing the Dark Web. The FBI has had the capability to use a computer and internet protocol address verifier (CIPAV) to ‘identify suspects who are disguising their location using proxy servers or anonymity services, like Tor’ since 2002 (Finklea Citation2015). This technology allows Tor traffic to be flagged separately from regular internet traffic. It does nothing to compromise the anonymity of users, but it is helpful in narrowing down search parameters when the FBI performs an investigation. The Department of Defense’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is developing a tool called Memex, which can uncover patterns to help law enforcement combat illegal activity (Finklea Citation2015). This project is another way that investigative agencies could make sense of Tor traffic without having to unmask all Tor users. Instead, investigators could detect specific patterns and then track down the specific user making the suspicious requests.
                
                An important case study occurred in February of 2015. The FBI used a hacking tool to identify the IP addresses of users accessing a hidden Tor child abuse site called Playpen (Cox Citation2016). Within a month of being launched in 2014, Playpen had 60,000 member accounts. By 2015, there were 215,000 accounts, 117,000 posts, and 11,000 unique visitors per week (Cox Citation2016). In order to take down the site, the FBI took the unprecedented move of seizing the Playpen server and transferring the site to an FBI server, under a warrant issued by a federal magistrate judge in the Eastern District of Virginia (Satterfield Citation2016). The FBI ran Playpen off their server from 20th February to 4th March of 2015 and were able to access the computers of about 1000 Playpen users during that time. That resulted in sufficient evidence to bring about 1500 cases against people accessing images of child abuse on Playpen (Cox Citation2016). This tactic managed to capture only those who were accessing the child abuse site while leaving other users of Tor untouched. While some may have ethical qualms about the FBI running a child abuse server for a couple weeks, there is a strong argument to be made that by identifying the users, the FBI was able to prevent further access to images of child abuse in the future. As a result, Tor users will feel slightly less protected by their anonymity when they are accessing illegal sites, but other people who browse using Tor regularly can still enjoy comfort and anonymity in their legal activities.
                
                Legal frameworks are essential in supporting criminal investigations. There is a debate over whether the federal magistrate judge from the Eastern District of Virginia had the legal authority to issue a warrant that led to searches outside the judge’s district. This is an example of current U.S. laws not keeping up with evolving technology. The FBI maintains that the warrant was valid because the server was being run from a site located in the judge’s district (Satterfield Citation2016). However, in the nine cases that have been brought so far using evidence from this sting operation, six judges have written opinions to indicate that the first federal judge did not have the authority to authorise searches outside his jurisdiction (Satterfield Citation2016). The problem that arises from this debate is that it would have been impossible to identify the users of Playpen, and then get warrants for each user, if it had not been for the tool that the FBI installed on the server. To be clear, the FBI later got individual warrants to search the computer of every suspect identified in the case (Satterfield Citation2016). A policy solution must be found which gives the FBI a stronger legal footing for employing such an effective investigative technique in the future.
                
                The takedown of Silk Road was a case where FBI tactics were somewhat less than fully successful. To be sure, the operator, Ross Ulbricht, was arrested, but since the FBI shut down Silk Road in October of 2013, there has been an explosion in the darknet market for illegal goods. The market was previously centralised around Silk Road, but it has become more fragmented. There is a Reddit directory of Dark Web marketplaces that is updated to inform users which ones are reputable and which ones are unreliable, and the list of untrusted sites is far longer than the list of trusted ones (Swearingen Citation2014). Almost immediately after Silk Road was shut down, users flocked to a previously unknown site called the Sheep Marketplace. This site dominated the Dark Web market until a vendor exploited a vulnerability and stole $6 million in bitcoins (Swearingen Citation2014). Silk Road 2.0 was launched by former administrators of the original Silk Road on 6th November 2013. This came only one month after the original Silk Road was shut down. Silk Road 2.0 was short-lived. It was hacked in February 2014 by a vendor who stole $2.7 million in users’ bitcoins (Swearingen Citation2014). That was not the end of the Silk Road however. Silk Road 3.0 is considered the most resilient Dark Net market and has been operational since May 2016 (Darknet Markets Are Not beyond the Reach of Law Citation2016). Thus, while the government took down the original Silk Road, it is clear that that operation was not entirely successful, as it did little to dissuade people from starting new Dark Web marketplaces, and it did not hold vendors or customers accountable for their transactions on the site. As Eric Jardine points out, these criminal activities conducted on the Dark Web may be knocked down, but other programmes emerge and simply take their place (Jardine Citation2015).
                
                Another unsuccessful case of government intervention in Dark Web matters came in March of 2015 when federal investigators served a subpoena to Reddit in which they demanded the personal data of five users who accessed r/darknetmarkets, a forum where users discussed illegal online marketplaces (Finklea Citation2015). This was an unwise action because it discourages future discussion on open forums such as Reddit. If criminals are driven away from open and easy-to-monitor pages and towards pages that are hidden in the Dark Web, it makes the FBI’s job of finding cybercriminals much more challenging.
                
                The three case studies described above cover the spectrum from effective to ineffective enforcement. The best tactics are those that are narrowly focused, like the ones the FBI employed to take down Playpen. In other words, these tactics search for the criminals in places where anyone visiting the site is a criminal. This is the best of both worlds because it allows for long-term deterrence while protecting user privacy to the maximum extent reasonable. In the interest of continuing to be effective, the FBI must be given a stronger legal framework to perform such investigations. The tactic that was used with Silk Road, of merely taking down a site, has a short-term pay-off, but it is largely ineffective in the long run because other marketplaces will pop up to meet the demand. The tactic that was employed with the Reddit forum was essentially a failure. It did nothing to deter illegal activity, and it squandered an opportunity to monitor discussion in the open and more tactfully identify those involved with illegal activity. In examining these cases, it is clear that tactful, carefully directed operations will be most successful in deterring future illegal activity on the Dark Web while being mindful of innocent users’ privacy.<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23738871.2017.1298643" target="_blank">[4]</a></p>

            <p>Because of the anonymity provided by Tor and other software such as I2P, the Dark Web can be a
                playground for nefarious actors online. As noted, however, there are a number of areas in which the study and use of the Dark Web may provide benefits. This is true not only for citizens and
                businesses seeking online privacy, but also for certain government sectors—namely the law
                enforcement, military, and intelligence communities. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="textDiv">
            <p>Just as criminals can leverage the anonymity of the Dark Web, so too can law enforcement. It
                may use this to conduct online surveillance and sting operations and to maintain anonymous tip
                lines.94 While individuals may anonymize activities, some have speculated about means by which
                law enforcement can still track malicious activity.
                As noted, the FBI has put resources into developing malware that can compromise servers in an
                attempt to identify certain users of Tor. Since 2002, the FBI has reportedly used a “computer and
                internet protocol address verifier” (CIPAV) to “identify suspects who are disguising their location
                using proxy servers or anonymity services, like Tor.”95 It has been using this program to target
                “hackers, online sexual predators, extortionists, and others.”96 Law enforcement has also
                reportedly been working with companies to develop additional technologies to investigate crimes
                and identify victims on the Dark Web.
                97
                In addition to developing technology to infiltrate and deanonymize services such as Tor, law
                enforcement may rely upon more traditional crime fighting techniques; some have suggested that
                law enforcement can still rely upon mistakes by criminals or flaws in technology to target
                nefarious actors. For instance, in 2013 the FBI took down the Silk Road, then the “cyberunderworld’s largest black market.”98 Reportedly, “missteps” by the site’s operator led to its
                demise; some speculate that “federal agents found weaknesses in the computer code used to
                operate the Silk Road website and exploited those weaknesses to hack the servers and force them
                to reveal their unique identifying addresses. Federal investigators could then locate the servers
                and ask law enforcement in those locations to seize them.”99
                Less than one month after federal agents disbanded the Silk Road, another site (Silk Road 2.0)
                came online. After discovering that the site’s proprietor made critical errors, such as using his
                personal email address to register the servers, federal agents seized the servers and shut down the
                site.100 While law enforcement may aim to defeat criminals operating in the Dark Web
                technologically, some of their strongest tools may be traditional law enforcement crime-fighting
                means. For example, law enforcement can still request information from entities that collect
                identifying information on users. In March 2015, federal investigators “sent a subpoena to Reddit
                demanding that the site turn over a collection of personal data about five users of the
                r/darknetmarkets forum [a subreddit where users discussed anonymous online sales of drugs, weapons, stolen financial data, and other contraband].”101 Though, as some have suggested, such
                law enforcement actions could drive these conversations and activities to anonymous forums such
                as those on Tor.  <a href="https://a51.nl/sites/default/files/pdf/R44101%20(1).pdf" target="_blank">[5]</a></p>

            <p>Although the strict anonymity of the DWSN narrowed the scope of my work (in that I could not talk to DWSN members offline), an ethnography of any SNS must also be focused. Despite being less accessible than “clear web” SNSs such as Facebook or Twitter, the DWSN has shown evidence of growth since its founding in 2013. During my observation of the site over a period of 10 months, the DWSN’s number of accounts grew from 3000 to over 24,000, with over 170 groups, hundreds of blog posts, and tens of thousands of micro-blog posts. Although these are not numbers on the scale of Facebook or Twitter, they are impressive, given that finding the DWSN is not a simple matter of Googling for it. More to the point, it would be impossible to observe or speak with thousands of people.
                To focus my study, I sought lenses (or “categories,” as Koopman and Matza (2013) would call them) with which to illuminate activities on the DWSN. The two I use are power and freedom. These lenses, I should stress, are not free-floating concepts that I will simply grab from a theoretician and then “apply” to the DWSN. These lenses come from the context in which the DWSN emerges: the “media ideology” (Gershon, 2010) of the dark web, specifically as this ideology appears in journalistic coverage. This coverage forms part of the historical context the DWSN finds itself operating in, and thus, journalists’ articulation of “power” and “freedom” informs the experiments with power/freedom I explore in the DWSN below.
                I see two main threads in news reporting about the dark web, with one dominant and the other less dominant but quite prevalent. First, there is the conception of the dark web as entirely composed of illegal or taboo activities and in need of policing. Second, there is the idea that the dark web can preserve a valued liberal freedom: freedom of speech. Thus, what appears in this media ideology is a “reciprocal and incompatible” (Foucault, 2006: 529; Koopman, 2013: 163) relationship between power and freedom.
                The popular media coverage of the dark web is redolent of moral panics that have been associated with Internet culture over the past 35 years, such as the panic about computer hackers and phone phreaks in 1980s (resulting in the arrest of many young computer users); the US Congress’ Communications Decency Act of 1996, brought on by a moral panic about pornography on the Web; and the US Congress Deleting Online Predators Act of 2006, inspired by moral panics over pedophiles on Myspace. Especially since the media coverage of the Silk Road drug market bust and the Freedom Hosting child pornography (CP) bust, both in 2013 (Borland, 2013), the dark web is currently inspiring similar panics centering on fears of CP, the drug and gun trade, and killers for hire.
                One Sun headline is a series of adjectives that bind the dark web with CP: “Child sex dark web targeted” (Wooding, 2013). A reporter for The Age notes the dark web is “where pornographic images to satisfy the most depraved tastes can be downloaded” (Ormsby, 2012). The dark web is “a hub for black markets that sell or distribute drugs” (Pagliery, 2014). Gizmodo profiled the dark web gun store The Armory, asking “Could a band of anonymous weapon mongers prepare me and 19 imaginary compatriots for illegal warfare? If you’ve got a spare million or so, looks like the answer is yes” (Biddle, 2012). The Daily Mail calls Tor a “seething matrix of encrypted websites” where one could hire hitmen for US$10,000. “So for those looking to bump off a difficult acquaintance, all they have to do is enter the Deep Web—known also as the ‘Dark Web’ or the ‘Undernet’—and search ‘hitman for hire’” (Mail Online, 2013). Implicit throughout this coverage is a call for more policing of the dark web (e.g. Biddle, 2012; Bingham, 2013; Gillespie, 2013; Henry, 2013; Murad and Hines, 2012).
                Despite this dominant idea of the dark web as only useful to pedophiles, assassins, and junkies, recently more Internet users have started to use Tor and even hidden .onion sites (see Figure 1). This rise has been attributed in part to Edward Snowden’s revelations about National Security Agency (NSA) and General Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) surveillance of the Internet (Borland, 2013). For privacy purposes, this is a positive development; more Tor users means more traffic and thus more obfuscation of user identities (Dingledine et al., 2004). This ties in with a secondary thread in popular coverage of the dark web: its affordances for journalists, activists, and whistleblowers who want to speak freely, despite state monitoring of the Internet. Many of the above-cited stories note that anonymizing software such as Tor can benefit anyone who wants to dissociate speech from identity, including political dissidents (e.g. Pagliery, 2014).
